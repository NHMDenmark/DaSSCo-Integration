| Name | Type of field | Part of which document | Description | Value | Why do we have this field | Populated by whom and when | Updated where and when | Maps to in ARS | Maps to in Specify | Issues |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| asset_created_by | String | Metadata | An asset is created by a pipeline or sync with Specify. Hence this field will be the name of the pipeline that created the asset. It could also be created via a specific intervention - e.g., transferring assets from one place to another. Would it therefore be the person scripting this or logged on that appears as a name here? | None | It tells where the asset originated from. | Upon event | Never | None | None | This could be part of the event protocol in ARS populating the user field. Currently that field will be populated by the digitiser when you create a new asset in ARS. The field does not exist as such in ARS. NT documentation says this should be filled when asset is synced with erda. |
| asset_deleted_by | String | Metadata | An asset could be deleted by a pipeline (and therefore the name of the pipeline that deleted the asset will be shown here. This is taken from pipeline_name). An asset could also be deleted by a member of the project team if they have sufficient privileges. Mostly this will be very rare after the asset has been locked. A record of the file should remain even if the asset no longer exists if deleted following locking of the asset (post processing). | The name of the Pipeline that deleted the asset. This will be picked from the "pipeline_name", sent under delete.Fx PIPEHERB0001 | Because it tells us something important | Upon event | Never | None | None | The same as the asset created by. |
| asset_guid | String | Metadata | This is the unique GUID generated for each asset and is generated before incorporation into the storage system. Parts of the string are defined based on things such as the workstation and institution, the other parts are randomly generated. This is to enable a unique name for each asset. It is mandatory for our funding that we also have persistent identifiers for each asset (ideally resolvable as well). So we imagined an easy way to do this would be to incorporate the guid into a persistent identifier that can be clicked on to resolve (see asset_pid). | None | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | asset_guid | None | None |
| asset_locked | Boolean | Metadata | Flags if it is possible to edit / delete the media of this asset. Note that this should only lock the media asset, not its associated metadata. | True, False | Because it tells us something important | Set to false when asset is created by ARS. | Updated in ARS. When has not been decided. | asset_locked | None | This does not exist in our metadata anymore. It should be deleted at some point from here. It is currently not possible to edit or add to an asset that has been locked in ARS. We are missing some option to do this. There is some not so important timing issues with it where you can add files to a share that was open before the assets metadata got updated to locked. |
| asset_pid | String | Metadata | We have not decided how this is constructed yet. One possible PID is to construct a URL like pid.dassco.dk/GUID1234555677243. This is then the unique and resolvable identifier that we will use when sharing. | None | Because it tells us something important | TBD | Never | asset_pid | None | This is a requirement for creating an asset in ARS. We donï¿½t have a way of creating this. We are inserting dummy values for now. |
| asset_subject | String | Metadata | This is to define what the asset is a representation of | One of the following strings: folder, device target, specimen, label | Because it tells us something important | Running pipeline | Never | subject | Part of the Title field together with payload_type | Naming mapping issue with ARS. |
| asset_updated_by | String | Metadata | Entity that updated the asset | None | Because it tells us something important | TBD | Never | None | None | This field is I think never used. It does not exist in ARS. Not sure what updating the asset (not metadata means). |
| audited | Boolean | Metadata | This is to mark the record as to having been manually audited. This will occur after complete processing and syncing with Specify. | True or False | Because it tells us something important | TBD | Never | audited | None | None |
| audited_by | String | Metadata | This is the name of the person who audited the asset. Auditing will be done independently of the digitisation and usually by the technical team leader or a senior digitiser. | Presumably the name comes from the Identity Manager? | Because it tells us something important | TBD | Never | None | None | Does not exist in ARS. Maybe is part of the event protocol. |
| audited_date | String | Metadata | This is the date the asset was audited. Auditing happens following complete processing of the asset following digitisation. | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ or NULL | Because it tells us something important | TBD | Never | None | None | Same as audited by. |
| barcode | List of strings | Metadata | "This refers to a physical barcode on the specimen consisting of 8 digits. It is part of an ID unique to that specimen and consisting of: An institution acronym, a collection acronym, and the barcode. We can have one specimen barcode related to multiple assets and in sme cases one asset with multiple specimen barcodes (an example of the later is a multispecimen herbarium sheet)." | 8 Digit code prefaced by the institution. The institution string is NOT part of the encoded digit code.Fx NHMD00929517 | Because it tells us something important | Running pipeline | Never | barcode | Catalog Number | None |
| collection | String | Metadata | This is the collection name (a collection of related specimens) within the institution that holds the specimen and should align with Specify collections for synchronisation (also part of specimen registration number for NHMA). | FX Vascular plants | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | collection | None | None |
| date_asset_created | String | Metadata | Missing description | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Because it tells us something important | Upon event | Never | date_created and timestamp in event protocol | None | Naming mapping issue with ARS. |
| date_asset_deleted | String | Metadata | Missing description | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Because it tells us something important | Event based | Never | date_asset_deleted and timestamp in event protocol | Date Media Deleted | Missing information on when this can happen. |
| date_asset_finalised | String | Metadata | Tells when an asset was finalised. | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Timestamp for when an asset was finalised. | Note | Never | date_asset_finalised and timestamp in event protocol | None | Finalised, locked and audited is confusing. |
| date_asset_taken | String | Metadata | A date and time of when the original raw image was taken | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | date_asset_taken | None | Does not persist in ARS (bug). |
| date_asset_updated | String | Metadata | Missing description | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Because it tells us something important | Note | Never | None | None | Does not exist in ARS. Not sure what this is meant to tell. What does updating an asset mean? |
| date_metadata_created | String | Metadata | Missing description | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient | Never | None | None | Does not exist in ARS. |
| date_metadata_updated | String | Metadata | Timestamp for when an assets metadata was updated. | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ or NULL | Lets us keep track of when an asset had its metadata updated. | Event based and populated by ARS | After each update to an assets metadata in ARS | None | None | We can only keep one value here despite the asset potentially having its metadata updated multiple times. |
| date_metadata_uploaded | String | Metadata | Missing description | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Because it tells us something important | Event based | Never | None | None | Never gets filled out. Does not exist in ARS. |
| digitiser | String | Metadata | This is the name of the person who imaged the specimens (creating the assets). This will be included in the metadata collected at the end of the days imaging during mass digitisation. It is the digitisers who also specify the pipeline at the end of the days digitisation, the pipeline will be run automatically. This won't be filled in when image is added direct from Specify. Instead, in that case, the author would be filled in in the attachments metadata in Specify. | None | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | digitiser | Copyright(?) | Cannot be updated in ARS. Should there be another field for the person who uploaded the asset. |
| external_publisher | List of strings | Metadata | A list of URLs to external publisher sites or just names of the publishers, to which we are publishing this asset and a user can download the asset from the publisher (a reverse link). This should be searchable to see what is being published where. | None | Because it tells us something important | Note | Never | external_publisher | None | Needs some kind of url check. Not sure if this is implemented in ARS, we are missing it for integration server. |
| Field name | String, boolean | Metadata, track data, mos data, etc | Please remember that there are two white spaces after each header. Also all these headers must be present, if you dont have a any input for one just write TBD or None in it. | None | Because it tells us something important | Note | Never | None | None | None |
| file_format | String | Metadata | The format of the asset | tif, jpeg, raf | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | file_formats | File Format | Name mapping issue. We are using a single value in lower case. ARS is using a list of values all in upper case that must come from a enum list. Specify is using a single value I think. What happens if assets can have thumbnails (jpegs) added to them? |
| funding | String | Metadata | A short description of funding source used to create the asset | Dassco Tranche 1 | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | funding | None | None |
| institution | String | Metadata | The name of the Institution which owns and digitised the specimen | NHMD, AU | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | institution | Defines the list that maps to Copyright(?), License and Credit | None |
| metadata_created_by | String | Metadata | Metadata could be created via a DaSSCo refinery pipeline, a scripted event (still a pipeline?) or via Specify | The name of the Pipeline that created the metadata. This will be picked from the "pipeline_name", sent under metadata creation.Fx PIPEHERB0001 | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | None | None | This does not exist in ARS. |
| metadata_updated_by | String | Metadata | Metadata can be updated manually, via pipelines and via Specify | The name of the Pipeline that created the metadata. This will be picked from the "pipeline_name", sent under metadata creation.Fx PIEHERB0001 | Because it tells us something important | Note | Never | user in the event protocol | None | We can only keep one value here despite the asset potentially having its metadata updated multiple times. |
| metadata_uploaded_by | String | Metadata | Missing description | None | Because it tells us something important | Note | Never | None | None | This never gets filled out. Does not exist in ARS. Missing info. |
| multispecimen | Boolean | Metadata | Basically a multispecimen is a single image (or other type of media) that actually contains multiple specimens in it. Thus one asset is linked to multiple specimens. On one hand it is data that needs to carried through to Specify (multispecimen objects are modelled using containers in Specify); however, we can imagine needing to search on this in the storage registry to check the pipeline has worked as it should for these specimens and assets. But also, how many multispecimen objects we have dealt with is an important statistic for measuring and helping refine workflows. | True or False | It let us differentiate between MOS and non MOS assets. | Running pipeline | Never | multi_specimen | None | Naming mapping issue |
| parent_guid | String | Metadata | This is the name of the parent media and in most cases will be the same as the original_parent_name, but can be different if a derivative of a derivative. | None | Because it tells us something important | Running pipeline | Never | parent_guid | None | This field cannot have an empty string in ARS it must be "null" or an actual parent guid. There is a bug where it can be overwritten to null again (not sure exactly how this works though). |
| payload_type | List of strings | Metadata | Missing description | None | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | payload_type | Part of the Title field together with asset_subject | We have a list, ARS has a single value. Can this be multiple things? |
| pipeline_name | String | Metadata | The name of the Pipeline, which has sent an create, update or delete request to the storage service. It is the pipeline that creates the asset, but we will create derivatives (multiple assets per specimen), so will probably need to explore this in relation to specimen as well. Need to check if mandatory to create an asset (e.g., when adding assets other than via a mass digitisation pipeline). | 8 characters followed by 4 digitsFx PIPEHERB0001 | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | pipeline | None | Naming mapping issue |
| preparation_type | String | Metadata | This relates to the way the specimen has been prepared (e.g., a pinned insect or mounted on a slide). Whilst this is specimen data, it is also fundamental to how we are keeping track of the project - as the different ways a specimen is prepared will affect our planning, our pipelines, reporting etc. Hence, incorporating this field into the registry makes sense. | sheet, pinned, dry, slide (and more will be added as the project progresses) | Because it tells us something important | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | preparation_type in the specimen protocol | None | Gets shortened to the first letter in ARS - "sheets" become "s" |
| pushed_to_specify_date | String | Metadata | Missing description | ISO 8601:YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZor NULL | Because it tells us something important | Event | Never | None | None | Does not exist in ARS. Maybe its part of the event protocol. |
| restricted_access | List of strings | Metadata | Missing description | None | Because it tells us something important | Note | Never | restricted_access | None | We have not decided how this is meant to work. There is a schema in the pipeline write up appendix for values that could go here. ARS has its own enum list that values must conform to. |
| specimen_pid | String | Metadata | We need a system to uniquely resolve assets. We don't currently have a system in place for this. We need to develop this. | None | Because it tells us something important | Note | Never | specimen_pid part of the specimens protocol | Persistent Identifier | Missing decision on how and where to construct this. |
| status | String | Metadata | The status of the asset. It | For processing, being processed, working copy, archive, processing halted, for deletion, issue with media, issue with metadata | Because it tells us something important - nope, currently we are not using this for anything. | Populated by integration server just before upload if empty. | Never | status | None | We donï¿½t use this. It must be populated for an asset to get created in ARS. Missing decisions. |
| tags | Dictionary containing key strings each with a value string. | Metadata | We are still developing our pipelines and can imagine the need to add additional fields in the future. It would be good to have a field to cover ourselves if we discover the need to additionally annotate our metadata assets until we can add more. | A dictionary of dynamic propertiesFx "ocr": ocr_tex | Gives us flexibility to incorporate new information or make changes without having to overhaul the whole system immediately. | Can be populated by anyone at anytime. | Anytime and anywhere. | tags | None | Best field ever! Does everything when you need it. Currently gets populated with metadata_template: v2.1.0 |
| workstation_name | String | Metadata | This is the name of the workstation used to do the imaging. The name of the work_station, was used when working on this create, update or delete request. | 8 characters followed by 4 digitsFx WORKHERB0001 | Tells us which workstation an asset originated from | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never | workstation | None | Naming mapping issue with ARS. |
