| Name | Type of field | Part of which document | Description | Why do we have this field | Populated by whom and when | Updated where and when |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| disposable_id | String | MOS | The id used by digitisers to show the connection between MOS assets. | We use this to connect assets that are part of the same MOS. | Integration server when it receives an update about an asset denoting it as a MOS asset. | Never |
| created | Date | MOS | Timestamp for database entry | Helps searching for assets when things have gone awry. | Integration server when it receives an update denoting an asset as part of a MOS. | Never |
| label | Boolean | MOS | Flag showing if the asset is a label. | Labels metadata need to be handled differently than normal assets so we want to keep track of this. | Integration server when it receives an update denoting an asset as part of a MOS. | Never |
| label_connections | List of strings | MOS | List of guids belonging to assets connected through the same unique label id. | Lets us know which assets are part of the same MOS. | Integration server when it receives an update denoting an asset as part of a MOS. | Integration server. Whenever another asset with the same unique_label_id is found. |
| spid | String | MOS | Specimen id. Consist of institution + collection + the barcode found on the asset. This assumes no MOS MSO is possible. | ??? | Integration server when it receives an update denoting an asset as part of a MOS. | Never |
| unique_label_id | String | MOS | Needed because labels are not necessarily unique. Assumes labels used on 1 day for a workstation are not reused. Consist of workstation name + date asset taken + label id. Which is the same as batch id + label id. | Let clump together assets that are part of the same MOS. | Integration server when it receives an update denoting an asset as part of a MOS. | Never |
| _id | String | MOS | The unique identifier for the document. This is the same as the asset guid. | Lets us know which asset we are dealing with. | Integration server when document is created. Documents in this database are created when a MOS is discovered. | Never |
