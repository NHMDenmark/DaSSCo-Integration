## "asset_pid"

**Type of field:**  
String

**Description:**  
We have not decided how this is constructed yet. One possible PID is to construct a URL like pid.dassco.dk/GUID1234555677243. This is then the unique and resolvable identifier that we will use when sharing.   

**Value:**  
None  

**Why do we have this field:**  
Because it tells us something important  

**Populated by whom and when:**  
TBD  

**Updated where and when:**  
Never  

**Maps to in ARS:**  
asset_pid

**Maps to in Specify:**  
None

**Issues:**  
This is a requirement for creating an asset in ARS. We don’t have a way of creating this. We are inserting dummy values for now.
