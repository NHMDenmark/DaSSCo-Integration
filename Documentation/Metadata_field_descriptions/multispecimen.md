## "multispecimen"

**Type of field:**  
Boolean  

**Part of which document:**  
Metadata

**Description:**  
Basically a multispecimen is a single image (or other type of media) that actually contains multiple specimens in it. Thus one asset is linked to multiple specimens. On one hand it is data that needs to carried through to Specify (multispecimen objects are modelled using containers in Specify); however, we can imagine needing to search on this in the storage registry to check the pipeline has worked as it should for these specimens and assets. But also, how many multispecimen objects we have dealt with is an important statistic for measuring and helping refine workflows.  

**Value:**  
True or False

**Why do we have this field:**  
It let us differentiate between MOS and non MOS assets.   

**Populated by whom and when:**  
Running pipeline 

**Updated where and when:**  
Never
