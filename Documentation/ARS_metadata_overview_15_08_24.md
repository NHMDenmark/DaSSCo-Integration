| asset_guid | String | ARS | This is the unique GUID generated for each asset and is generated before incorporation into the storage system.

So we imagined an easy way to do this would be to incorporate the guid into a persistent identifier that can be clicked on to resolve (see asset_pid). | Example: 7e8-7-17-14-1d-32-0-001-04-000-097367-00000 | Allows us to uniquely identify each asset. | Running IngestionClient/pipeline | Never |
